# BA-Sentiment-analysis
This project is based on deriving insights by scraping the data from Skytrax.
Data is raw and it is about the British Airways Airline's customer service. Natural Language Processing is used to analyse the review. There  are many methods to analyse the text data, and I used sentiment analysis to find Insights.
